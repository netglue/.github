# Net Glue Ltd

… is a small web design and development firm located in Devon, UK. We/I have been going for a pretty long time… Since around 2003.

Net Glue Ltd is mostly [gsteel](https://github.com/gsteel)

There's not a huge volume of public repositories on this GitHub account - what is here, tends to be open source work relating to [Laminas](https://github.com/laminas) and [Mezzio](https://github.com/mezzio) which tends to be the main frameworks and tools we use for making stuff. Also worth mentioning is the open source work we've written for working with the "[Prismic](https://prismic.io)" headless content management system.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find contact details on our old and tired [public website](https://netglue.uk), but please bear in mind that our availablity is pretty scant at the moment.
